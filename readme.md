# Transformer Architecture

Transformer Architecture incorporate the main three parts:

a. The encoder-decoder framework

b. Attention Mechanism

c. Transfer Learning

The encoder module encodes the input sequence , preserving the positional information into n-dimensional vector called embeddings. The decoder decodes that very input embeddings to text using different decoding strategies(i.e Greedy search, Beam search, etc.)
